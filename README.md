## About

If you get access denied error when running the addin authentication, please run Visual Studio in Administrator mode to get 3 legged authentication working

Add your credentials(Client ID and Client Secret) in the appsettings.json File

Currently the addin uses "http://localhost:3000/api/aps/callback/oauth as the callback
